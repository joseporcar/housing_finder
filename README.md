This is a utility that will email you when new housing is found in the platform Kamernet.

## Usage instructions: 
1. Paste the file `.env.template` into a file called `.env` (or js rename it) and change the placeholder values for your own!!
1.1. Something important, this will only work with gmail and you need an app password. I tried with proton but this project is too time sensitive to properly understand SMTP. 
2. TODO
